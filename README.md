# LedgerLens

**LedgerLens** is an AI‑powered financial forecasting & reporting platform for SMBs.  
It auto‑ingests payments and accounting data (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, Plaid),  
runs rolling forecasts (Prophet/Exponential Smoothing), and delivers:

- **MRR dashboard** with month‑over‑month growth  
- **3‑month P&L forecast** charts  
- **Cash‑runway indicator**  
- **Natural‑language executive summaries**  

All under a self‑serve, 2‑click onboarding, with tiered plans (Starter → Growth)  
and an optional Advisor Marketplace for expert review.

2. **Forecast** runs automatically on your historical data—no BI team needed.  
3. **Review** your dashboard or receive monthly emailed PDF reports.  
4. **Scale** with add‑on advisory services as you grow.
